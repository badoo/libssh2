.SH NAME
libssh2_sftp_write - write SFTP data
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>
#include <libssh2_sftp.h>

ssize_t 
libssh2_sftp_write(LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE *handle, const char *buffer, size_t count);

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIhandle\fP - SFTP File Handle as returned by 
.BR libssh2_sftp_open(3)

\fIbuffer\fP - Pre-initialized data buffer to write to the LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE.

\fIcount\fP - Number of bytes from buffer to write. Note that it may not 
be possible to write all bytes as requested.

Write a block of data to a LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE. This method is modeled after the POSIX write() function and uses the same calling semantics.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Actual number of bytes written or negative on failure.  It returns
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.

.SH ERRORS
\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_ALLOC\fP -  An internal memory allocation call failed.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_SEND\fP - Unable to send data on socket.

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT\fP - 

\fILIBSSH2_ERROR_SFTP_PROTOCOL\fP - An invalid SFTP protocol response was 
received on the socket, or an SFTP operation caused an errorcode to 
be returned by the server.
