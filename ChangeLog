2009-04-02  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, include/libssh2.h: release 1.1

2009-03-31  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/sftp.c, example/simple/sftp_write.c,
	example/simple/sftp_write_nonblock.c: Sofian Brabez removed
	duplicate calls to libssh2_session_set_blocking()

2009-03-31  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: Uh, it is important that we don't set the local
	state 'local.close' to TRUE until _after_ we're done as otherwise we
	might not get called again properly to clean the entire thing since
	the close state is checked in libssh2_channel_free

2009-03-30  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/packet.c: Removed the trace output that said "May block until
	packet of type..." since it simply wasn't true for non-blocking
	operations.

2009-03-29  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c, src/channel.h, src/sftp.c: made sure the SFTP code
	makes more use of internal non-blocking functions instead of the
	external API entries

2009-03-28  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/userauth.c: Fixed the memory leak in in
	libssh2_userauth_hostbased_fromfile_ex() that Jean-Louis Charton
	found. Additional minor indent and comment edits.

2009-03-28  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/userauth.c: indent changes and removed libssh2_ prefix from
	static function

2009-03-28   Yang Tse

	* src/version.c: include libssh2_priv.h instead of libssh2.h in
	order to get LIBSSH2_API properly defined on LIBSSH2_WIN32 build
	targets

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c, src/channel.h, src/sftp.c: Additional non-blocking
	fixes.

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/sftp.c: Me and my long fingers couldn't resist "merging"
	these statements in a previous commit but of course that broke
	functionality and this is a revert of that change.

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/transport.c: Dump to stderr simply because the other tracing
	functions in misc.c already use stderr and mixing output "channels"
	causes too much confusion for me!

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c, src/channel.h, src/session.c, src/sftp.c: fixed
	sftp_shutdown() for the blockiness and fixed libssh2_channel_close()
	to work properly non-blocking

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/libssh2_priv.h: Fixed the order of the check in the
	BLOCK_ADJUST() macro so that it also works for
	libssh2_session_free()

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* tests/simple.c: kill warnings

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/libssh2_priv.h: Fix the BLOCK_ADJUST_ERRNO() macro to behave
	properly in blocking mode.

2009-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in: Add AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR to avoid warnings with
	libtool v2.2.x.

2009-03-27  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/kex.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/misc.c, src/session.c,
	src/sftp.c: fix comments, moved to htonu64 function to sftp.c and
	made it static

2009-03-26  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/Makefile.am, src/comp.h, src/kex.c, src/libssh2_priv.h,
	src/mac.c, src/mac.h: More cleaning up converting libssh2_ to
	_libssh2_ for internal functions and removing libssh2_ from static
	functions. Added mac.h.

2009-03-26  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/Makefile.am, src/comp.c, src/comp.h, src/kex.c: comp.c only
	as a single _libssh2_ function, no external one

2009-03-26  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, TODO, docs/Makefile.am,
	docs/libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data.3,
	docs/libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust.3,
	docs/libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust2.3,
	docs/libssh2_channel_set_blocking.3, include/libssh2.h,
	src/Makefile.am, src/channel.c, src/channel.h, src/kex.c,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/packet.c, src/session.c, src/sftp.c,
	src/transport.c, src/transport.h, src/userauth.c:
	* Renamed the functions in src/transport.c to be _libssh2_transport_
	  prefixed and introduced a transport.h header.

	* Fixed the blocking mode to only change behavior not the actual
	  underlying socket mode so we now always work with non-blocking
	  sockets. This also introduces a new rule of thumb in libssh2 code:
	  we don't call the external function calls internally. We use the
	  internal (non-blocking) ones!

	* libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust2 was added and
	  libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust is now deprecated

	* Introduced "local" header files with prototypes etc for different
	  parts instead of cramming everything into libssh2_priv.h. channel.h
	  is the first.

2009-03-25  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/scp_nonblock.c: avoid some busy-looping

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* TODO: one function to remove, one proto to correct

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/sftp.c: Updated comments and removed "libssh2_" prefixes from
	static functions

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/libssh2_session_get_blocking.3: added basic docs

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/libssh2_session_flag.3: quite possibly one of the most
	pointless functions in the libssh2 API...a

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/misc.c: ENOTCONN obviously doesn't exist in win32 so don't
	try to map that

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: [no comment]

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: EEK revert the part of the previous commit that
	was just my non-functional attempts to make things work with
	blocking sockets.

2009-03-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/packet.c: I cut out the
	poll_socket argument from the protos for_libssh2_packet_askv() and
	_libssh2_packet_ask() since they are internal and nothing in the
	code base uses that functionality == simplicity with no drawbacks!

2009-03-19  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/libssh2_priv.h, src/misc.c: pass in unsigned ints for u32
	values and not longs

2009-03-19  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/misc.c, src/session.c,
	src/transport.c:
	- (Mar 19 2009) Daniel Stenberg: based on a patch by "E L" we now
	  use errno properly after recv() and send() calls (that internally
	  are now known as _libssh2_recv() and _libssh2_send()) so that the
	  API and more works fine on windows too!

2009-03-18  Daniel Stenberg

	* AUTHORS: I'm upgrading myself!

2009-03-17  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* tests/ssh2.sh: Add StrictModes=no to work around cygwin problem.
	Reported by Yang Tse <yangsita@gmail.com>.

2009-03-17  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* tests/ssh2.sh: Add UsePrivilegeSeparation=no for cygwin.
	Reported by Yang Tse <yangsita@gmail.com>

2009-03-17  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/packet.c: re-indented for clarity

2009-03-17  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: re-indented _libssh2_channel_packet_data_len()
	somewhat to make the huge condition somewhat easier on the eye

2009-03-17  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c, src/comp.c, src/crypt.c, src/hostkey.c, src/kex.c,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/mac.c, src/misc.c, src/openssl.h,
	src/packet.c, src/publickey.c, src/scp.c, src/session.c,
	src/sftp.c, src/transport.c, src/userauth.c: A cleanup effort:
	libssh2_ prefixes only on external APIs. Use _libssh2_ prefix for
	library-wide internal functions. Don't use any of those on static
	functions.  I also did some comments and whitespace changes.

2009-03-17  Daniel Stenberg

	* include/libssh2.h: bump packet default size to 32768

	name as the actual function

2009-03-16  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS: mention the basic changes in my previous few commits

2009-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/scp.c: Patch from bug report #1960894 by "Heiner" applied,
	and edited by me. It makes SCP recv and send deal with file names
	containing spaces (and other shell-special letters) by quoting them
	before they are passed to the remote server.

2009-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/scp.c: fixed some wrong comments and did a minor code edit
	and some further whitespace changes

2009-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_channel_receive_window_adjust.3,
	docs/libssh2_channel_window_read_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_channel_window_write_ex.3: added three more public
	functions I found lacking man pages

2009-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/scp.c: fix a compiler warning

2009-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/scp.c: simplified how the "scp" command line is created in
	the libssh2_scp_recv() function

2009-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c, src/libssh2_priv.h: Simplified
	libssh2_channel_read_ex() and made it send window adjustments less
	frequent, use a few less struct fields in the channel struct and
	improved reading from the network with libssh2_packet_read(). I also
	modified the windowing algorithm and now use a much larger window.
	This greatly enhances SSH/SCP performance. I also increased the size
	of the buffer the transport layer uses from 4k to 16K.

2009-03-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/misc.c: oops, use %06d for the microseconds!

2009-03-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/packet.c: re-indented and other whitespace edits

2009-03-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/misc.c: improved trace logs with time stamps

2009-03-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/scp_nonblock.c: fixed to work quite similar to the
	sftp_nonblock example so that it waits for the socket correctly and
	measures the transfer speed fine

2009-03-13  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/channel.c, src/kex.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/misc.c,
	src/packet.c, src/session.c, src/sftp.c, src/transport.c,
	src/userauth.c: Cleanups, that do seem to have boosted SFTP
	download performance up to 300% in some tests:

	  * cut off "_ex" from several internal function names

	  * corrected some log outputs

	  * simplified libssh2_channel_read_ex() and made it much faster in
	  the process

	  * cut out {{{ and }}} comments that were incorrect anyway

	  * fixed sftp_packet_ask() to return the correct packet by using
	    memcmp() and not strncmp()

	  * fixed mkdir()'s wait for packet to use the correct request_id - it
	    semi-worked previously because strncmp() in sftp_packet_ask()
	    made it match far too easily.

	  * took away the polling functionality from sftp_packet_ask() since
	    it wasn't used

2009-03-13  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/sftp_nonblock.c: improved non-blocking behavior
	for some of the initing stuff before the actual data transfer begins

2009-03-13  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/sftp_nonblock.c: wait for socket action
	accordingly, and do some measurements on the transfer to make this
	better to use for speed tests

2009-03-07  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/channel.c:
	- (Mar 7 2009) Olivier Hervieu pointed out a flaw in the
	  libssh2_channel_x11_req_ex() function that made it produce a
	  crappy random chunk of data. Peter Stuge improved the fix to not
	  do out-of-boundary writes. I (Daniel Stenberg) replaced the
	  snprintf() with a plain sprintf() since the size argument wasn't
	adding anything anyway.

2009-03-06   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/Makefile.netware, nw/test/Makefile.netware,
	win32/Makefile.win32, win32/test/Makefile.win32: some minor
	Makefile tweaks.

2009-02-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_version.3,
	include/libssh2.h, src/Makefile.am, src/version.c:
	- Added libssh2_version()

2009-02-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/channel.c:
	- (Feb 20 2009) libssh2_channel_direct_tcpip_ex() bug #1902169
	  fixed, which caused it to fail when called a second time.

2009-02-17  dottedmag

	* docs/libssh2_base64_decode.3: Fixed dash-as-minus warning in
	libssh2_base64_decode.3 manpage

2009-02-17  dottedmag

	* docs/libssh2_banner_set.3: Fixed syntax error in
	libssh2_banner_set.3 manpage

2009-02-16  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: Bump ABI revision from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 due to
	code changes.

2009-02-16  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* include/libssh2.h: Fix typo.

2009-02-16  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* NEWS: Add date for v1.0 release.

2009-02-12  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/channel.c:
	- (Feb 12 2009) Romain Bondue extended Markus Moeller fix from Feb
	  8, based on a previous (uncommitted) patch by Erik Brossler. It
	  improves libssh2_channel_write_ex in blocking situations when the
	  socket is set non- blocking.

2009-02-08  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/channel.c: Markus Moeller fixed a flaw in
	libssh2_channel_write_ex() that would occur on EAGAIN situations.

2009-01-01  Daniel Stenberg

	* TODO: I want to remove all those macros from the official API at
	next soname bump

2009-01-01  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/kex.c, src/scp.c, tests/ssh2.c: fixed compiler warnings, and
	stripped off "libssh2_" from static functions as that makes shorter
	function names and then making the code look fine within 80 columns
	is easier!

2009-01-01  Daniel Stenberg

	* include/libssh2.h, include/libssh2_publickey.h,
	include/libssh2_sftp.h: made the three public headers use (mostly)
	lines shorter than 80 columns as HACKING says - it makes them much
	more readable to my old tired eyes...

2008-12-28  Daniel Stenberg

	* include/libssh2.h: we're actually working on the 1.0.1 version
	now (or should it be 1.1?)

2008-12-26  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am, TODO: Added 'TODO' file (again) with some fresh
	things I could think of right now

2008-12-26  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_trace.3: Added libssh2_trace man
	page

2008-12-26  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/libssh2_base64_decode.3: libssh2_base64_decode is deprecated
	and subject for removal in a future version (like on the next soname
	bump)

2008-12-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_base64_decode.3: wrote up a first
	libssh2_base64_decode man page, added a few missing man pages to the
	tarball

2008-12-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/libssh2_sftp_rename_ex.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_rmdir_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_stat_ex.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_unlink_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_write.3: based on Heiner Steven's report, fix the
	name and description of these man pages!

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS: briefly mention my recent sftp-related fixes

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* README: mention web site and mailing list, as I think they're not
	mentioned anywhere else in the package!

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/sshentry.c: removed obviously superfluous comments

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/misc.c: use a single >>32 instead of "(value / 65536) /
	65536", just make sure that the shift is done on a 64bit type

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/transport.c: remove unused #ifndef, and two whitespace
	changes

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: style/indent changes only to enforce < 80 column
	lines more strict

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, docs/libssh2_sftp_seek.3, include/libssh2_sftp.h,
	src/sftp.c: libssh2_sftp_seek64() it is now for the 64bit seek
	function too as the seek2 name has never been used in a release and
	it makes the naming consistent

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/libssh2_session_block_directions.3, include/libssh2.h: 0.19
	is now 1.0

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, docs/libssh2_sftp_tell.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_tell64.3,
	src/sftp.c: Based on Alexander Lamaison's patch, there's now a new
	function called libssh2_sftp_tell64() that returns the 64 bit file
	offset, as the existing libssh2_sftp_tell() only returns a size_t.

2008-12-22  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/libssh2_priv.h, src/sftp.c: first conversion of a malloc =>
	buffer in the sftp handle struct

2008-12-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* libssh2-style.el: helper script for emacs users to get the code
	style done libssh2-style automatically

2008-12-19  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, src/sftp.c:
	- Markus Moeller fixed the issue also reported by Alexander Lamaison
	  which caused SFTP reads with large buffers to fail.

2008-12-17  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* tests/ssh2.sh: Sshd is slow to start on some systems.

2008-12-17  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/libssh2_priv.h, src/sftp.c: Avoid one malloc by putting the
	entire handle buffer in the handle struct at once, use a define for
	the maximum size length of the handle instead of '256' in the code.

2008-12-16  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/sftp.c: removed some more libssh2_ prefixes from private
	functions

	Made the libssh2_sftp_open_ex() deal with servers that first
	responds with STATUS OK and then sends the actual HANDLE. It seems
	openssh does this at times and it screwed things up. To me it seems
	like a spec violation...

2008-12-16  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: removed unused code, intended the code somewhat

2008-12-16  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/sftp.c: Nothing used libssh2_sftp_packet_read's flush
	argument anymore so I removed it and simplified the code somewhat
	thanks to that. I then renamed the function to sftp_packet_read()
	only since it is private in this file anyway.

2008-12-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/sftp.c: renamed libssh2_sftp_packet_requirev to plain
	sftp_packet_requirev since it is private in this file only and a
	shorter name is nicer

	Removed a "flush" of the data in sftp_packet_requirev() that now
	seems to have made SFTP operations a lot more reliable. It didn't
	make much sense to have it there but if someone can present a reason
	for one I figure we should carefully investigate one and only do it
	conditionally where/when needed.

2008-12-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* NEWS, docs/Makefile.am, include/libssh2.h, src/kex.c,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/packet.c, src/session.c, src/transport.c:
	- Vlad Grachov brought the new function called
	  libssh2_session_block_directions() which returns a bitmask for
	  what directions the connection blocks. It is to be used
	  applications that use non-blocking sockets and when a libssh2
	  function returns LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN this function can be used to
	  figure out in which direction the socket would block and thus it can
	  wait for the socket to again be ready for communication in that
	  direction before it calls libssh2 again.

	* NEWS: mention libssh2_channel_request_pty_size_ex()

2008-10-02   Paul Thomas

	* src/channel.c: This fix addresses bug# 2141548. Channel reads
	would fail despite libssh2_poll() detecting that there was data
	ready to be read on the socket. This is seen when small amounts of
	data are ready to be read, typically 1-4 chars worth.

2008-10-01   Paul Thomas

2007-08-03   James Housley

	* example/simple/ssh2.c: libssh2_userauth_list() requires the
	lenght of the username to be passed, and not the sizeof() the array
	holding it.

2007-08-03  Daniel Stenberg

	* include/libssh2.h: LIBSSH2_APINO is now gone, the sooner the
	better. This is gonna cause some pains in apps relying on it, but it
	is broken by design and we should not rely on it at all. Go for the
	LIBSSH2_VERSION_* defines instead if you need to check for versions.

	examples no longer have an include path pointing to the private
	source dir but instead uses its own config.h file, that now is
	included first to make large file magic have an effect.

2007-07-31  Daniel Stenberg

	* configure.in: add large file magic checks, and make sure we
	update the config.h file in the example/simple subdir as well

2007-07-31  Daniel Stenberg

	* buildconf: create a private config.h file for the examples

2007-07-30  Daniel Stenberg

	* acinclude.m4: Peter O'Gorman pointed out (and fixed) that the
	non-blocking check in configure made libssh2 use blocking sockets on
	AIX 4 and 5, while that wasn't the intention.

2007-07-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* configure.in, src/session.c: libssh2_poll() no longer relies on
	C99 features but instead uses alloca() on systems that have it - and
	uses a fixed-size array on those that don't.  session.c was also
	cleaned from a large amount of trailing whitespace.

2007-07-22   Guenter Knauf

	* example/simple/sftp.c: ooups - forgotten var added.

2007-07-22   Guenter Knauf

	second choice (if implemented).

2007-07-19   Guenter Knauf

	future implementation of keyboard-interactive method.

	* example/simple/ssh2.c: removed obsolete line.

2007-07-19   Guenter Knauf

2007-07-19   James Housley

	* src/scp.c, src/session.c:
	* After setting the error to the error string from in the packet,
	  set the pointer to NULL so it can't be double freed.
	* On session cleanup be sure to free the last error if it needs to
	be

2007-07-18   James Housley

	* src/userauth.c: The test after the memory allocation was
	backwards, so keyboard-interactive would always fail due to a memory
	problem.

2007-07-18   Guenter Knauf

	* example/simple/ssh2.c: fixed call to libssh2_userauth_list()
	since NULL isnt supported for the username.

2007-07-18   Guenter Knauf

	* example/simple/ssh2.c: added check for available authentication
	methods.

2007-07-17   Guenter Knauf

	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: added NMakefile to Makefile.am so
	that it gets included with releases and daily snapshots.

2007-07-16   Guenter Knauf

	* example/simple/ssh2.c: added test success messages.

2007-07-16   Guenter Knauf

	* include/libssh2.h: another trial to fix the typedefs.

2007-07-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am: add maketgz to release archives

2007-07-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, maketgz, include/libssh2.h: Added
	LIBSSH2_TIMESTAMP to the public header and it contains the timestamp
	of the making of the release archive.

	Added 'maketgz' as a script to build release archives with,
	including automated snapshots or whatever. It updates the defines in
	include/libssh2.h.

	configure now extracts the version number from the include/libssh2.h
	header in the source tree instead of using it fixed set in the
	script (to remove the need for regenerating the configure script
	when we run maketgz).

	Makefile.am now has a dist-hook that puts ".dist" files in the
	release tree instead of the file without the .dist extension, so
	that we can easily add modified files in release archives. Like
	maketgz.

2007-07-15   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/test/Makefile.netware: fixed test makefile to build all
	samples.

2007-07-15   Guenter Knauf

2007-07-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* HACKING, Makefile.am: Metion the current code style in the new
	file called HACKING. In this, we could also add descriptions on how
	to send us patches and bug reports etc...

2007-07-14   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/Makefile.netware, nw/test/Makefile.netware: some more NetWare
	makefile fixes.

2007-07-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/scp_write.c, example/simple/scp_write_nonblock.c,
	example/simple/sftp_write.c, example/simple/ssh2.c: removed
	compiler warnings, narrowed some source lines, killed trailing
	whitespace

2007-07-14   James Housley

	* include/libssh2.h: For now make LIBSSH2_APINO a long, some
	compilers make constants an int it seems.

2007-07-09   Guenter Knauf

	* include/libssh2.h, nw/Makefile.netware, nw/nwlib.c, nw/nwlibc.c:
	added build for older CLIB version.

2007-07-09   James Housley

	* src/libssh2_priv.h, src/sftp.c: The variable "packet" needs to be
	in LIBSSH2_SFTP_HANDLE for re-entry when blocking in
	libssh2_sftp_close_handle()

2007-07-08   James Housley

	* src/channel.c: While the previous commit seemed to correct a
	problem, it actually exposed another problem.  Commit this until a
	proper fix is found

2007-07-08   James Housley

	* src/channel.c: Remove a blocking while loop that wasn't removed
	when the code to return PACKET_EAGAIN was added, but should have
	been.

2007-07-05   James Housley

	* example/simple/scp_nonblock.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/scp.c:
	* Since the packet as already had data read from it, it can't retrun
	  PACKET_EAGAIN while reading the rest of it.
	* Get the error message in libssh2_scp_recv() in the same manner as
	  it was gotten in libssh2_scp_send_ex()

2007-07-05   Guenter Knauf

	* include/libssh2.h: fix bug #1701782 - for now we only define for
	the compiler versions where we know for sure - if later versions
	still need those defines please report to the list.

2007-07-05   Guenter Knauf

	* include/libssh2.h: enter next round after release.

2007-07-05   James Housley

	* example/simple/scp_write_nonblock.c, src/channel.c,

	Debian's lintian)

2007-06-28  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/pem.c: as mentioned in bug #1655429, the CRLF pair was
	stripped off in the wrong order!

2007-06-25  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am: added missing files (in 0.15) to the release tarball

2007-06-23   James Housley

	* src/channel.c, src/publickey.c, src/userauth.c:
	* Eberhard Mattes submitted a patch "According to RFC 4251, a
	boolean value of true is encoded as 1, not as 0xff".  Servers should
	accept any non-zero value.

	Bug:	1703472

2007-06-22   James Housley

	* nw/Makefile.netware: update export list for recent changes

2007-06-18   James Housley

	* src/channel.c, src/libssh2_priv.h: libssh2_channel_read_ex()
	needed more changes to fully support non-blocking IO

2007-06-18   James Housley

	* src/sftp.c: Small fixes:
	* libssh2_sftp_packet_read() - use the right variable for the
	        number of bytes returned by libssh2_channel_read_ex()
	* libssh2_sftp_packet_requirev - only call libssh2_waitsocket() when
	        in blocking IO mode

2007-06-18  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* Makefile.am: Fix distcheck.

2007-06-13   James Housley

	* docs/libssh2_channel_read_ex.3, docs/libssh2_channel_write_ex.3:
	Update to reflect the current code and add possible error values

2007-06-12   James Housley

	* src/channel.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/publickey.c, src/scp.c,
	src/session.c, src/sftp.c, include/libssh2.h,
	include/libssh2_publickey.h: libssh2_channel_free() actually can
	return PACKET_EAGAIN.  Update all calling functions to support that
	with the following API notes:

	* libssh2_publickey_shutdown(), libssh2_session_free() changed
	  to return an "int" to allow signaling of LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN.

	* libssh2_scp_recv(), libssh2_scp_send_ex() and libssh2_sftp_init()
	  will loop in on libssh2_channel_free() when there is an error.
	  It is not possible to return LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN in this
	  condition in these 3 functions and not lose the original error
	code.

2007-06-10   James Housley

	* docs/libssh2_channel_readnb_ex.3: The function no longer exists

2007-06-10  Daniel Stenberg

	* include/libssh2.h: include sys/types.h since the compile breaks
	on Linux otherwise - we need ssize_t from there

2007-06-10   James Housley

	* src/libssh2_priv.h, src/session.c, src/userauth.c: Sharing state
	vairables between the userauth functions was a nice idea, but
	libssh2_userauth_list() can't share with the others.  So to be safe
	don't have any share.

2007-06-10   James Housley

	* win32/libssh2_config.h: Add a define for vsnprintf, similar to
	snprintf that is already there.

	Bug:	1702156

2007-06-10   James Housley

	* src/publickey.c: Fix misspelling in trace

	Bug:	1703464

2007-06-09   James Housley

	* src/libssh2_priv.h: Since uint32_t is used, inttypes.h should be
	included.

2007-06-08   James Housley

	* src/kex.c: In the code rewrite
	libssh2_kex_method_diffie_hellman_group14_sha1_key_exchange() lost
	two initializer routines, restore them.

2007-06-08   James Housley

	error interface always use LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN.
	LIBSSH2CHANNEL_EAGAIN and LIBSSH2SFTP_EAGAIN are still valid, but
	are defined as LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN.

2007-06-08   James Housley

	* src/session.c: libssh2_session_disconnect_ex() should be
	returning PACKET_EAGAIN instead of LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN, so it
	matches the other functions return values.

2007-06-07   James Housley

	* src/channel.c, src/publickey.c, src/session.c, src/sftp.c,

	variables

2007-06-07   James Housley

	Propogate the EAGAIN error all the way up to the user interface.
	All code modules bug sftp.c have been completed.

	Functions that return an "int", or similar return
	LIBSSH2CHANNEL_EAGAIN to indicate some part of the call would block,
	in non-blocking mode.

	Functions that return a structure, like "LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *", return
	NULL and set the libssh2 error.  The error can be obtained with
	either libssh2_session_last_error() or libssh2_session_last_errno().
	Either of these will return the error code of LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN
	if the call would block, in non-blocking mode.

	The current state of a function and some variable are keep in the
	structures so that on the next call the operation that would block
	can be retried again with the same data.

2007-06-06   James Housley

	* src/transport.c: libssh2_packet_read() was checking the "errno"
	even when recv() didn't return an error.  "errno" should have been
	zero by the recv() call but doesn't seem to be on all systems.  Only
	check when recv() says there is an error.

	* include/libssh2.h, include/libssh2_publickey.h,
	include/libssh2_sftp.h, src/channel.c, src/comp.c, src/crypt.c,
	src/hostkey.c, src/kex.c, src/libgcrypt.c, src/libgcrypt.h,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/mac.c, src/misc.c, src/openssl.c,
	src/openssl.h, src/packet.c, src/pem.c, src/publickey.c, src/scp.c,
	src/session.c, src/sftp.c, src/transport.c, src/userauth.c:
	Initially the libssh2 code was indented with tabs of 4 spaces.  Some
	of the recent commits converted the tabs to 4 spaces, which matched
	the initial indent size.  Other commits converted the tabs to 8
	spaces, this didn't match.

	All the code has been converted to 4 space indents.  No changes to
	line lengths or actual code was performed.  This is in preperation
	to my up coming non-blocking work so my commits should only be code
	changes and line lengths in the code I am working on.

2007-05-08  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/transport.c: Eberhard Mattes' fix for libssh2_packet_read()
	for when reading very small chunks at a time.

2007-05-01   Dan Fandrich

	* example/simple/Makefile.am: Fix building out of the source tree.

2007-04-26   Guenter Knauf

	* example/simple/Makefile.am, example/simple/scp.c,
	example/simple/scp_nonblock.c, example/simple/sftp.c,
	example/simple/sftp_RW_nonblock.c, example/simple/sftp_mkdir.c,
	example/simple/sftp_mkdir_nonblock.c,

	example/simple/sftp_write_nonblock.c, example/simple/sftpdir.c,
	example/simple/sftpdir_nonblock.c, example/simple/ssh2.c: include
	libssh_config.h to get the configure vars in.

2007-04-26   Guenter Knauf

	* configure.in, example/simple/scp.c,
	example/simple/scp_nonblock.c, example/simple/sftp.c,
	example/simple/sftp_RW_nonblock.c, example/simple/sftp_mkdir.c,

	example/simple/sftpdir_nonblock.c, example/simple/ssh2.c,
	win32/libssh2_config.h: changed to configure defines to control
	inclusion of headers from libssh2_config.h.

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/Makefile.am, example/simple/sftp_mkdir.c,
	example/simple/sftp_mkdir_nonblock.c: Test programs for
	libssh2_sftp_mkdir_ex() and libssh2_sftp_mkdirnb_ex()

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_sftp_mkdir_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_mkdirnb_ex.3: Document libssh2_sftp_mkdir_ex()
	and libssh2_sftp_mkdirnb_ex()

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* src/sftp.c, include/libssh2_sftp.h: Make _libssh2_sftp_mkdir_ex()
	fully non-blocking safe.  This makes libssh2_sftp_mkdirnb_ex()
	non-blocking safe and libssh2_sftp_mkdir_ex() blocking safe

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* docs/libssh2_sftp_init.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_open_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_read.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_readdir.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_readdirnb.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_readnb.3:
	libssh2_sftp.h is needed for all of these functions

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* docs/libssh2_sftp_readdir.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_readdirnb.3: Fix a
	couple of locations where read should have been readdir

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* src/sftp.c: libssh2_sftp_seek() and libssh2_sftp_tell() are
	NB-SAFE, since they only set variables

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/Makefile.am, example/simple/sftp_write.c,
	example/simple/sftp_write_nonblock.c: Create two sample programs,
	similar to sftp.c and sftp_nonblock.c, that will test blocking and
	non-blocking write SFTP transfers

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* src/sftp.c: Make _libssh2_sftp_write() fully non-blocking safe.
	This makes libssh2_sftp_writenb() non-blocking safe and
	libssh2_sftp_write() blocking safe

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftp_nonblock.c: Commit the version that actually
	uses the non-blocking code

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftp_nonblock.c: Commit the version that actually
	uses the non-blocking read

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftp_nonblock.c: Update comment

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/Makefile.am, example/simple/sftp_nonblock.c: Make
	sftp_nonblock.c a non-blocking version of sftp.c, just like
	sftpdir.c

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftp_RW_nonblock.c: Move sftp_nonblock.c to
	sftp_RW_nonblock.c, since it isn't just a non-blocking version of
	sftp.c.  It has different command line parameters and tries to do
	more

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* src/sftp.c: Make _libssh2_sftp_read() fully non-blocking safe.
	This makes libssh2_sftp_readnb() non-blocking safe and
	libssh2_sftp_read() blocking safe

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftp.c:
	* Explicity set blocking

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftpdir.c: Unless we tell libssh2 that we are
	blocking, which we are because didn't set the socket to non-blocking
	it will think we are in non-blocking mode in a lot of places

2007-04-22   James Housley

	* example/simple/sftpdir_nonblock.c: Add comment about setting
	non-blocking

2007-04-21   Guenter Knauf

	* win32/Makefile.win32, win32/test/Makefile.win32: fixed ARFLAGS
	for CodeWarrior build.

2007-04-21   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/test/Makefile.netware, win32/Makefile.win32,
	win32/test/Makefile.win32: some more makefile fixes.

2007-04-21   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/Makefile.netware, nw/test/Makefile.netware,
	win32/Makefile.win32, win32/test/Makefile.win32: fixed debug
	option.

2007-04-21   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/Makefile.netware: fixed ARFLAGS for CodeWarrior build; added
	libssh2_sftp_writenb to export list.

2007-04-21   James Housley

	* include/libssh2_sftp.h, src/sftp.c: Non-blocking work

	* The following low level packet routines now fully support
	    non-blocking: libssh2_sftp_packet_read()
	    libssh2_sftp_packet_ask()
	    libssh2_sftp_packet_require()
	    libssh2_sftp_packet_requirev()

	* libssh2_sftp_readdirnb() functions completely in non-blocking mode

	* The rest of the routines which call the libssh2_sftp_packet_*
	  routine loop on a return code of PACKET_EAGAIN.  This maintains the
	  current functionality until they fully support non-blocking

	* The state of all function are labeled with either NB-SAFE or
	  NB-UNSAFE, for those that are know.  NB-UNSAFE?? for those that
	  haven't been examined.

2007-04-21   James Housley

	* example/simple/Makefile.am, example/simple/sftpdir_nonblock.c:
	Create a simple test for sftp readdir with non-blocking

2007-04-21   James Housley

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_sftp_readdir.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_readdirnb.3: Document libssh2_sftp_readdir() and
	libssh2_sftp_readdirnb()

2007-04-19   Dan Fandrich

	* include/libssh2_publickey.h: Added some consts to struct members

2007-04-18   Dan Fandrich

	* src/kex.c, src/publickey.c, src/userauth.c: Fixed some compiler
	warnings and made some more tables 'const'.

2007-04-18   Dan Fandrich

	* NEWS, include/libssh2.h, include/libssh2_publickey.h,
	include/libssh2_sftp.h, src/channel.c, src/hostkey.c,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/misc.c, src/publickey.c, src/sftp.c,
	src/userauth.c: Made some function parameters in the API const.
	This is an API change, but correctly-written applications should see
	no source or binary compatibility issues.  Also fixed a few compiler
	warnings.

2007-04-17   Dan Fandrich

	* src/kex.c: Bail out on a short kex packet.

2007-04-17   Dan Fandrich

	* src/channel.c, src/comp.c, src/crypt.c, src/hostkey.c, src/kex.c,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/mac.c, src/misc.c, src/packet.c,
	src/session.c, src/sftp.c, src/userauth.c: Made most internal
	tables 'static const'.

2007-04-16   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/Makefile.netware, win32/Makefile.win32: added ranlib when
	library is created with ar.

2007-04-14   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/test/Makefile.netware: added sftpdir target; fixed linking.

2007-04-13   Dan Fandrich

	* Makefile.am: Make ChangeLog a phony target.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* src/channel.c: changed to configure defines to control inclusion
	of headers from libssh2_config.h.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* src/packet.c, src/misc.c: changed to configure defines to control
	inclusion of headers from libssh2_config.h.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* src/session.c: Win32 has no ENOTCONN - checked MSVC6, MingW32,
	Borland C++ 5.5, OpenWatcom 1.6; all have this define in winsock2.h
	but blocked with '#if 0'; changed to configure defines to control
	inclusion of headers from libssh2_config.h

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* nw/Makefile.netware: updated Makefile.netware to add more
	exports; fixed linking; updated OpenSSL version to have users use
	latest.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* win32/Makefile.win32: removed HAVE_IOCTLSOCKET define; updated
	OpenSSL version to have users use latest.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* include/libssh2_sftp.h: blocked unistd.h inclusion for Win32
	builds.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* include/libssh2.h: added two more typedefs but blocked them so
	they are only used with MSVC6 or lower (dont know if later MSVC
	versions still need them).

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* src/transport.c: fixed wrong type and sync with usage.

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* configure.in: check for sys/time.h

2007-04-12   Dan Fandrich

	* NEWS, src/channel.c, src/comp.c, src/kex.c, src/packet.c,
	src/publickey.c, src/session.c, src/userauth.c: Better handle out
	of memory situations.

2007-04-12  Daniel Stenberg

	* README: added --enable-debug

2007-04-12   Guenter Knauf

	* win32/libssh2_config.h: removed ENOTCONN define, added
	HAVE_IOCTLSOCKET define; added the new defines for inclusion of
	headers.

2007-04-12   Dan Fandrich

	* README, docs/libssh2_channel_forward_listen_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_poll.3, docs/libssh2_session_init.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_read.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_readnb.3,
	docs/template.3: Fixed some spelling mistakes in documentation.

2007-04-12   Dan Fandrich

	* src/channel.c, NEWS: libssh2_channel_close now waits for a
	SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE message from the server as mandated by the
	RFC.  Not doing so causes an OpenSSH server to occasionally corrupt
	(truncate) short files uploaded by scp (which manifests itself as a
	failure of test603 in the curl regression test suite).

2007-04-11  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in, src/libssh2_priv.h: Replace #if !WIN32 with #if
	HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H and HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H (AIX needs sys/ioctl.h).
	Reported by Michael Augustin
	<maugustin-hi6Y0CQ0nG0@public.gmane.org>.

2007-04-05  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/crypt.c: Use _libssh2_* namespace.  Suggested by Guenter
	Knauf <eflash-hi6Y0CQ0nG0@public.gmane.org>.

2007-04-05  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* config.rpath, configure.in, m4/lib-ld.m4, m4/lib-link.m4,
	m4/lib-prefix.m4, m4/libgcrypt.m4, src/Makefile.am: Use Bruno's M4
	macros to search for libgcrypt.

2007-04-05  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* install-sh, mkinstalldirs: Remove generated files.

2007-04-05  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* INSTALL: Moved to README.

2007-04-05  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/libssh2_priv.h: Need sys/ioctl.h for FIONBIO, tiny patch from
	Michael Augustin <maugustin@gmx.net>.

2007-04-05  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/libssh2_priv.h, src/packet.c, src/session.c: Fix AIX problem,
	based on patch from Michael Augustin <maugustin@gmx.net>.

2007-04-04  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/comp.c: Protect #include of zlib.h if we build without zlib.

2007-04-01  Mikhail Gusarov <dottedmag@dottedmag.net>

	* src/sftp.c: Enabled fragmenting SFTP requests to
	LIBSSH2_SFTP_PACKET_MAXLEN.

	(Thanks to elifantu@mail.ru for the patch)

2007-04-01  Mikhail Gusarov <dottedmag@dottedmag.net>

	* src/sftp.c: Missing brace added

2007-04-01  Mikhail Gusarov <dottedmag@dottedmag.net>

	* src/sftp.c: libssh2_sftp_read should not return error if it
	receives SSH_FX_EOF code in SSH_FXP_STATUS packet.

	(Thanks to elifantu@mail.ru for the patch)

2007-03-31  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: Callers should be using libssh2_packet_require_ex
	instead of libssh2_packet_ask_ex. The purpose of these calls is to
	clear out any packets that may have arrived already, so there's no
	need to poll for more.  (Dan Fandrich)

2007-03-29  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* include/libssh2.h: Don't use CPP symbol _MSC_VER unless it is
	defined, because undefined CPP symbols means 0.  Tiny patch from
	"Yang Tse" <yangsita@gmail.com>.

2007-03-29  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: Need -no-undefined for AIX/cygwin/mingw32 etc.
	Reported by "Yang Tse" <yangsita@gmail.com>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in: Add comment.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in: Set $SHLIB_SUFFIX_NAME properly, tiny patch from
	Daniel Johnson <daniel@daniel-johnson.org>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Remove -no-install since it breaks Darwin
	builds (probably a libtool bug), report from Daniel Johnson
	<daniel@daniel-johnson.org>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* NEWS: Add.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* NEWS: Add.

	* NEWS: Add -lsocket/-lnsl.  End sentences with '.'.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* NEWS: Add.  Start sentences with uppercase.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in: Use AC_SEARCH_LIBS on socket() for -lsocket, so we
	don't link with -lsocket unless it is necessary.  Remove
	SHLIB_LDFLAGS, it was never used by anything.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in: Fix typo.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/session.c:
	(libssh2_poll_channel_write, libssh2_poll_listener_queued): Mark as
	static.  Remove unneeded prototypes.  Break Solaris 10 builds
	according to "Heiko Jansen" <jansen@hbz-nrw.de>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/packet.c:
	(libssh2_packet_x11_open, libssh2_packet_queue_listener): Mark as
	static functions.  Remove unnecessary prototypes.  Breaks Solaris 10
	builds according to "Heiko Jansen" <jansen@hbz-nrw.de>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in: Search -lnsl for inet_addr, suggested by "Heiko
	Jansen" <jansen@hbz-nrw.de>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* README: Fix typo, reported by "Heiko Jansen" <jansen@hbz-nrw.de>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* Makefile.am: Dist buildconf, suggested by "Heiko Jansen"
	<jansen@hbz-nrw.de>.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* docs/Makefile.am: Add 'dist_' to make sure man pages are included
	in the release.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add rule to generate ChangeLog.  No need for foreign
	or nostdinc (correct me if I'm wrong?).

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* AUTHORS: Add.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* LICENSE: Remove.

	* COPYING: Add, from LICENSE.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* README: Rewrite, based on INSTALL.

2007-03-27  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* NEWS: Add, from README.

2007-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/openssl.c: Dan Fandrich fixed another memory leak, this time
	in the OpenSSL interface code:

	It's not clear to me whether all the BN_news in _libssh2_rsa_new
	need to be cleaned up, too.  The OpenSSL docs for RSA_free implies
	that you don't need to, and valgrind doesn't complain, so it's
	probably OK as is.

2007-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* README: give credit to those who made the changes

2007-03-15  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/packet.c: fixed a memory leak in the packet handling (Dan
	Fandrich)

2007-03-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/crypt.c, src/openssl.c, tests/Makefile.am: Dan Fandrich
	patch:

	1 - let libssh2 compile with OpenSSL 0.9.6b.  This is due to 'crypt'
	is found in one of its header files and EVP_MAX_BLOCK_LENGTH not
	being found.

	2 - The EXEEXT patch is because automake 1.7 doesn't support it, and
	recent automakes add it automatically

2007-02-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/Makefile.am, example/simple/sftpdir.c: Added
	sftpdir, a sample doing an SFTP directory listing

2007-02-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/libssh2_sftp_open_ex.3: nicer look

2007-02-23  Daniel Stenberg

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/libssh2_channel_read_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_channel_readnb_ex.3, docs/libssh2_channel_write_ex.3,
	docs/libssh2_poll.3, docs/libssh2_poll_channel_read.3,
	docs/libssh2_sftp_read.3, docs/libssh2_sftp_readnb.3: more/updated
	man pages

2007-02-14  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/transport.c: Lucas Newman found and fixed a problem where
	libssh2_packet_read() could "lose" bytes when it read data from the
	network that was an unaligned number of bytes compared to the
	blocksize.

2007-02-08  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/sftp.c: add include to fix compiler warning

2007-02-08  Daniel Stenberg

	* example/simple/sftp.c: Guenter Knauf added support for another IP
	and I changed the order of the arguments and updated some comments.

2007-02-08  Daniel Stenberg

	* nw/Makefile.netware, nw/test/Makefile.netware,
	win32/Makefile.win32, win32/test/Makefile.win32: Guenter Knauf's
	Netware+Win32 updates after my recent changes

2007-02-07  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: removed unused variable

2007-02-07  Daniel Stenberg

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in, src/channel.c: setting sockets
	non-blocking using more portable code and configure macros from the
	libcurl project (written by me)

2007-02-07  Daniel Stenberg

	* get_ver.awk, include/libssh2.h, nw/Makefile, nw/Makefile.netware,
	nw/keepscreen.c, nw/nwlibc.c, nw/test/Makefile.netware,
	src/libssh2_priv.h, src/session.c, win32/Makefile,
	win32/Makefile.win32, win32/libssh2_config.h,
	win32/test/Makefile.win32: Netware and Windows fixes by Guenter
	Knauf

2007-02-06  Daniel Stenberg

	* include/libssh2.h: let's call the current version 0.15-CVS

2007-02-04  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* configure.in, src/session.c: Remove unused uses of -lm and
	math.h.

2007-02-04  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* README: Fix.

2007-02-02  Daniel Stenberg

	* configure.in, example/simple/scp.c, include/libssh2.h,
	src/channel.c, src/kex.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/misc.c,
	src/packet.c, src/publickey.c, src/scp.c, src/session.c,
	src/sftp.c, src/transport.c, src/userauth.c: 1 - new public
	 function libssh2_trace() that enables tracing/debug output on
	various stuff if libssh2 was built with debug. If built without
	 debug, the function does nothing.  2 - configure --enable-debug is
	now enough to build a debug version (including picky compiler
	options) 3 - internally, we no longer need/use #ifdef/#endif around
	all uses of the _libssh2_debug() function/macro.

	The scp.c example is the first application to test this new debug
	logging.

	* README: non-blocking and man pages

2007-02-02  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, docs/Makefile.am: Include man pages in
	distro tarball and make install. Note that this is still (by far) an
	incomplete set of man pages.

2007-02-02  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/Makefile.am: bump the version-info due to the changes in the
	API we're working on and due to the fact that there's release of the
	previous CVS-state shipped in Debian (and possibly others distros).

2007-02-02  Daniel Stenberg

	for the SECSH transport layer read/write in a non- blocking way. The
	channel code is now responsible for enabling/disabling blocking
	status and to work with it.

	I've also modified indenting and fixed compiler warnings at places,
	and added a bunch of new examples in example/simple that I've used
	to verify that the code still runs like before.

	libssh2_channel_{read|write}nb_ex() and
	libssh2_sftp_{read|write}nb() are the four new functions that
	supposedly work non-blocking.

	and RNG, and implement them via OpenSSL/libgcrypt.

2007-01-15  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* m4/libgcrypt.m4: Add, for libgcrypt.

2007-01-15  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	libssh2 also link to OpenSSL.

2007-01-10  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/hostkey.c, src/kex.c, src/libssh2_priv.h: Remove unfinished

	* ssh2_sample.c: fix warnings and allow passing user name and
	password on the command line

2006-12-13  Daniel Stenberg

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in: Added the configure option
	--enable-debug-build which not only enables a debug build (using -g
	and disabling all -O options), but also sets a whole range of
	picky/strict compiler options depending on what compiler and version
	that is used. This function is ripped right off the curl configure
	script, written by yours truly. I left it using the same name as in
	the curl script to 1) make it obvious where it comes from, so that
	2) it will be easier to update and keep it in sync with future
	modifications.

	Now, this shows MAAAAAAAAANY warnings...

2006-12-13  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/session.c: Removed use of ceil() since that is a math lib
	function and getting the exact accuracy of the microsecond to
	millisecond conversion simply cannot be that important. We don't
	even explicitly link with -lm...

2006-12-09  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/packet.c, src/session.c: Fix indentation.

2006-12-07  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

	* src/crypt.c, src/kex.c, src/libssh2_priv.h, src/packet.c,

2006-11-27  Mikhail Gusarov <dottedmag@dottedmag.net>

	* src/packet.c: Reading bigger blocks from network before
	decryption.  Significantly increases performance.

2006-11-27  Mikhail Gusarov <dottedmag@dottedmag.net>

	* src/packet.c: write(2) may write only part of passed data under
	FreeBSD.  Make sure whole buffer is written.

2006-11-24  Daniel Stenberg

	* README: mention a few recent changes

2006-11-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/Makefile.am: Add builddir/src to the include path, for the
	generated config header when building out of the source tree.

2006-11-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am: ssh2_sample now gets the right include path to the
	current include directory

2006-11-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* configure.in, src/libssh2_priv.h: check for inline in configure

2006-11-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, buildconf, config.guess, config.sub,
	configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	src/libssh2_config.h.in: Starting now, we use automake and libtool
	for the build.

2006-11-20  Daniel Stenberg

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, include/libssh2_config.h.in,
	include/libssh2_priv.h, src/libssh2_config.h.in,
	src/libssh2_priv.h: Moved the private include files libssh2_priv.h
	and libssh2_config.h.in from include/ into the src/ directory. The
	include/ dir is now strictly for public headers.

	Also, I removed the special win32 source package creation target in
	the makefile and I modified the contact email address in
	configure.in to point out the libssh2-devel list.

2006-11-19  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/publickey.c: kill compiler warnings

2006-11-19  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/Makefile.in: until we automake, let 'make' build all by
	default

2006-11-19  Daniel Stenberg

	* src/channel.c: kill warnings

2006-11-17  Daniel Stenberg

	* configure.in: Use pkg-config --cflags-only-I when getting the
	include files necessary to build with OpenSSL. Previous approach
	caused a bad compiler option get set.

2006-11-14   James Housley

	* src/packet.c: Patch from Daniel Stenberg

	1 - #include <inttypes.h> and uses uint32_t (this is not very
	    portable and need attention as I mentioned in my separate mail)

	2 - changes libssh2_blocking_read() to return ssize_t and all code
	    that uses this function explicitly checks its return code (better).

	3 - I fixed a bunch of compiler warnings where functions got called
	    with unsigned char * when they expect char *. I strongly suggest we
	    patch away all warnings - now.

2006-11-13   James Housley

	* include/libssh2_sftp.h: Reproduce most of the POSIX
	permission/file type defines from sys/stat.h so that if compiled
	with a non-POSIX compiler these are still available for client
	software.

2006-11-13   James Housley

	* src/userauth.c: As pointed out, feof() will always fail after a
	rewind

2006-11-13   James Housley

	* src/userauth.c: Bug: [ 1592645 ] Public key can not be readed
	from file

	While posting a public key file to a remote server via cut-n-paste
	it is possible that the key won't have the proper ending.  It might
	not have the standard carriage return or line feed.  It might even
	have extra spaces.  This patch is based on the originators original
	patch, but is more extensive.  If reading the file ends in EOF,
	remove that character.  Then if there are spaces at the end of the
	file remove them also.

	This does not fix the posibility of the same error in a multi-key
	file, but it is a start.

2006-11-10   James Housley

	* src/packet.c: /* RFC4253 section 6.1 Maximum Packet Length says:
	 *
	 * "All implementations MUST be able to process packets with
	 * uncompressed payload length of 32768 bytes or less and
	 * total packet size of 35000 bytes or less (including length,
	 * padding length, payload, padding, and MAC.)."
	 */ Protect against an improper packet from producing unreasonable
	values.  Credit goes to Daniel Stenberg

2006-11-10   James Housley

	* src/sftp.c: libssh2_sftp_readdir() wasn't null terminating the
	filename.  If there is enough room in the buffer, all a null to the
	end.

2006-11-04   James Housley

	* include/libssh2.h, include/libssh2_sftp.h, src/channel.c,
	src/misc.c, src/sftp.c, src/userauth.c: The public *_ex() API
	functions, most of them, used "int" for length values.  The
	convience functions pass in the return from strlen() which is
	"size_t", usually an "unsigned long".  This created the possiblility
	of passing in a value that could look negative.

	All "int" lengths were converted to "unsigned int".  Ideally they
	should all become "size_t", but that is a bigger change.  This is a
	good start.

	goes? Well, it's unencrypted, randomness doesn't help at that point.

	support for MAC methods: hmac-md5 and hmac-md5-96

	key_len should not have been in KEX_METHOD, it's dependent on MAC
	method, not KEX method.

	This is why the MD5 MACs were borked initially, md5 has a key_len of
	16, not 20.

2004-12-23  Sara Golemon <pollita@libssh2.org>

	* Makefile.in, TODO, configure.in, include/libssh2.h: Bump version
	for release and remove SFTP from TODO list

2004-12-23  Sara Golemon <pollita@libssh2.org>

	* README, src/packet.c: Make libssh2_packet_read() use a static
	buffer to avoid unnecessary alloc and free calls.

	Since the cipher and mac layers aren't runtime extensible (yet) and
	we know neither of these works in sizes greater than 32, we can
	safely set aside a 64 byte block of data on the stack for crypting
	and hashing.

	This will make a big difference during quasi-non-blocking reads
	where libssh2_packet_read() is polled repeatedly.

2004-12-22  Sara Golemon <pollita@libssh2.org>

	* src/packet.c, include/libssh2.h: A broken decrypt (or false
	packet) could cause an unreasonably large block of memory to be
	allocated leading to indeterminate results.

	SSH-TRANS only requires implementations to handle about about 32k
	compressed length per packet.  Allow 40k to be safe, but no more.
