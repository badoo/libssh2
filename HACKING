libssh2 source code style guide:

 - 4 level indent
 - spaces-only (no tabs)
 - open braces on the if/for line:

     if (banana) {
         go_nuts();
     }

 - write both braces on the else line:

     if (banana) {
         go_nuts();
     } else {
         stay_calm();
     }

 - use braces even for single-statement blocks
 
 - keep source lines shorter than 80 columns

------------

 Older libssh2 code that still hasn't quite transitioned to the above
 mentioned style, used a different style:

 - indented with tabs (only)

 - no line length limits
